## Minutes ##
  * Jordan had already drawn part of the bird's eye diagram. Reviewed and all approved.

  * Will do more research on the QA framework and will determine the group structure in the coming week.
  * Did not decide on leaders for any group, but encouraged group meetings to discuss. Will be closer investigated for assignment 2.
  * Aaron suggested dual roles for some members. Will only include main role for the presentation, but acknowledged that some members will fulfill more than one role during the implementation of the program.

    * Spellchecking, with Dictionary for search purposes
    * Timed-Access mode to disable access during certain times

    * Program is slow
    * Not useful for the user
