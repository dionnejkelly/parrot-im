## Vision Statement ##
To create a new, easy-to-use, fun, and feature-rich instant messaging program that is compatible with multiple protocols, including XMPP, to target any age and audience. We aim to provide a simple, yet powerful, communication program that will allow many users to enjoy their conversations as naturally as if they were talking face-to-face.

We expect to implement all of our proposed features, including the low-priority features, by Parrot IM's final release. We expect that users will run Parrot IM whenever they wish to be connected to their friends. Also, we expect that they will prefer to run Parrot IM over existing messaging solutions, such as ICQ and Google Talk.

<h2>List of Features</h2>
<img src='http://parrot-im.googlecode.com/files/Diagram.png' />

<ul><li><b>GUI</b> - friendly graphical user interface that allows the users to interact with the program with their keyboard and mouse.<br>
</li><li><b>Chatbot</b> - allows users to enable an auto-reply message that is designed to simulate an intelligent conversation with other human users.<br>
</li><li><b>XMPP Protocol</b> - the same protocol as Google Talk has used. Several servers and clients have support for this. Anyone can setup their own IM network using a XMPP server.<br>
</li><li><b>Tabbed Windows</b> - collapse multiple conversations into a single window separated into tabs.<br>
</li><li><b>Friend List</b> - tracks the list of users' friends, family, co-workers, and associates in an organized manner<br>

<h2>Scope of Phased Release:</h2>
<ul><li><b>Alpha</b> - Basic Protocol Program capable of person-to-person chatting, presence information, and simple GUI interfaces.<br>
</li><li><b>Beta</b> - Simple chat bot with response to certain commands and ability to search through old conversations. Ability to block people, add "friends", and adjust status.<br>
</li><li><b>Final</b> - User interface customization of colors, fonts and window formats. Help pages and features to make the program easy-to-use.</li></ul>


<h2>Features that will not be implemented</h2>
<br>

<ul><li><b>Webcam Chat</b> - to eliminate the low video quality and minimize the hardware requirements for using our software.<br>
</li><li><b>Audio Chat</b> - to cut down on development time to instead focus on the important aspects of the chat program.<br>
</li><li><b>Multiplayer Games</b> - would only be compatible with other users that run Parrot IM. This goes against our philosophy: you should be able to connect with any user, regardless of chat client.<br>
</li><li><b>Music Player</b> - would require additional work to design and implement the player, but there are already good solutions out there.
