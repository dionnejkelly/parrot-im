Blocking is a feature that allows you to restrict other users from both sending you messages and seeing that you are online. However, you can still see whether they are online or not; it is not the same as removing a user. Therefore, if you block a user, they will be completely unable to communicate with you. To block a user, right click their name on the Friend List and click "Block User".
