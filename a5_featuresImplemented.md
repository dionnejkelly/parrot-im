## Reasons for not implementing features ##

  * Advanced/Simplified Modes
    * Not enough benefit to the user to use a "simplified" mode.
    * Adds a layer of complexity and confusion to the user, rather than helping.
    * Too complicated to edit the entire GUI for minimal gain.
    * GUI plan changed over development; more features ended up in menus, rather than cluttered on screen.
  * Spam Filter
    * No feasible means of identifying what messages are "spam" without deleting legitimate messages.
  * Language Localization
    * A feature we'd like to still implement, but requires significant changes to the GUI, and not feasible for completion by release.
    * Requires additional space to store all language information on the database.
