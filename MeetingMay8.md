## Agenda ##
  * Assign members to subgroups (network, database, graphics, test framework)
  * Discuss assignment 1 requirements, such as the diagrams
  * Encourage brainstorming of features that we will NOT implement. For example, think of all the features we don't like from existing programs.
  * Product definition statement, that is a concise declaration of the application's main purpose and its intended audience (are they going to be MSN users, irc, YM, or all?)

## Minutes ##
  * Assigned members to the following teams:
    * Core - Communication Protocols (XMPP)
      * Wei
      * Rakan
      * Jihoon
      * William
    * Database (SQL)
      * Ahmad
      * Aaron
    * Graphical User Interface (GUI)
      * Vera
      * Chenny
      * Jordan
    * Quality Assurance Framework
      * Kevin
  * These teams will initially conduct research in their areas, with some serving other roles also. For instance the GUI team will provide mock-up diagrams to help the designing process.
  * Discussed which protocols to pursue. We must implement an XMPP client, and we decided to attempt Twitter and ICQ communication next, but these are medium-priority. If we have enough time left, we will pursue other protocols.
  * Jihoon drew an architectural diagram from our ideas, and Jordan is willing to digitize it. Aaron also expressed that he has Photoshop skills, if needed. This diagram will be colour-coded to reflect priority of the functions.
  * Vera suggested that the GUI team consider [HCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction) in designing the interface.
  * Also, cross-platform functionality was suggested. It should not be difficult, since we are writing in Java. Still, cross-platform ability will be a medium/low-priority function.

## Future Action ##
  * Jordan will upload a digital version of the architectural diagram.
  * We will continue brainstorming, especially of features that we do NOT like in existing clients.
  * Kevin will prepare a power-point and upload for critique and editing.
