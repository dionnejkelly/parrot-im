Simply closing the program's windows will not sign you off your chat network, and the program won't completely exit. To sigh-out properly, follow the steps below.

If you'd like to completely exit the program:

1. From the Friend List Window, at the top-left part of the window, click File --> Exit.

2. The program will close, with all the windows disappearing, and your account will be signed out, so no friends will see you online and you will not receive any messages.

If you'd like to log-out, but log-in as another user.

1. From the Friend List Window, click the green online icon, and you will see another menu.

2. Click the sign-out option.

3. You will be taken back to the Log-In Window, and can log-in as another user if desired.
