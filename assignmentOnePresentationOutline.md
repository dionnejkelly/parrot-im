Link to [ROUGH copy (v3)](http://parrot-im.googlecode.com/files/parrotIM_PresentationOne_v3.ppt) of presentation. It has no slide transitions yet, nor background, and looks ugly. Will fix. Need to change content, make it less wordy, and associate speech to the slide. Ending is rough. Please make any comments with regards to content, and give ideas for anything. Feel free to make changes to the file or edit this page. Possible edits:
  1. Suggestion for Theme Background


# Speech Matched Up With Slides #

  1. Title Page
    * Introduce ourselves.
    * Ask audience: how many people have used MSN, AIM, Facebook, ICQ, Twitter, IRC, Pidgin. How many of you know other communication tools I have not mentioned?
    * There's a lot out there, and you can do almost anything you want on them, so....
  1. "We're making another chat program"
    * Instead of expanding the pool of instant messengers, shouldn't we be consolidating them, and agree on one, good messenger to use universally?
  1. "Why make another chat program?"
    * Before we answer this, let's get a picture of what's already out there.
    * Just as you all have indicated, everyone uses online communication tools these days. Many people use multiple programs or websites just to stay in touch with all of their friends.
    * But there are also some very smart programs that do this for you; one program can connect to many networks, and you can chat with anybody who is online on anything.
    * Not only can you chat, but you can share pictures, send files, talk, see, and play games with your friends. Not only that, but each program has its own unique features.
    * And all of this ... is free. Well, mostly. You can use most of these programs for no monetary cost at all.
  1. However, they have their flaws
    * But, nothing in life is perfect, and computer programs are certainly not the exception.
    * There are a few minor flaws and grimaces with some programs. For instance, some programs restrict you to talking to friends in just one network. To talk to others, you need to download multiple programs.
  1. More flaws...
    * Also, even though most programs are free, they are mostly not open sourced. This means that you don't actually know what they are doing on your computer. You trust that they aren't data mining your private data, and you hope that they aren't slowing down your computer with inefficient code.
  1. Another flaw
    * And then some programs just are filled with so much stuff, that it's challenging to do what you actually want. In a perfect world, you would control what appears on your program's interface, not the company's advertising partners.
  1. Communication should be...
    * For whatever program you chose to use, online communication should be fun, easy, and useful. Just like in real life.
  1. What is the solution?
    * Now, how does all of this relate to making another chat program?
    * There is a void that can be filled.
    * A new messaging client that is easy to learn to use, attractive, and filled with useful features would be successful if it could connect you to all of your friends, regardless of their networks. Oh, and this program would have to be efficient and transparent also.
  1. We present to you...
    * We are creating this program.
    * It is called Parrot Instant Messenger, or Parrot IM for short.
  1. Parrot IM is...
    * Let's take a look at how our program will differ from the existing programs...
    * An essential requirement that Parrot IM has to fill is connectivity to multiple protocols. In layman's terms, this means that Parrot IM needs to connect clients using a variety of networks, including XMPP (Google Talk, Jabber), ICQ, and Twitter. Obviously, not all of these networks operate the same, so Parrot IM needs to account for these differences.
  1. What's in a name
    * The name, Parrot IM, is not random either. It reflects what we believe to be the most important features of a messaging program.
  1. Goals of Parrot IM
    * Let's talk some more about some of the defining aspects of Parrot IM.
    * Firstly, Simplicity is king. An identical feature can be made much better if it were accessed in a more simple manner. Therefore, we are creating a clean, attractive GUI that will allow the user to do things faster and more elegantly than before.
  1. More Goals of Parrot IM
    * Features is another important aspect. As we have mentioned, almost every feature conceivable has been implemented in one form or another. Therefore, we need to do two things: (1) Implement only the good, useful features, and leave out the junk, and (2) make innovations in how certain features work. One example of the second category is Chatbot. Basically, this lets you have the program say specific things to people who chat to you while you are away or busy, without appearing robotic or annoying. Another useful feature is our search function, which will find anything for you, be it contact information or a snippet of a previous conversation, from one convenient search box.
  1. More Goals of Parrot IM (2)
    * Finally, the most important, yet often ignored, priority of Parrot IM is for it to be fun to use. We want your chatting experience to be as natural as it can be. To do this, we  need not only a great-looking UI, but we need a functional UI also, one that aims to help you find information rather than file and hide it. But at the end of the day, Parrot IM's chatting experience must be as fun as possible.
  1. Target Audience
    * With all that said, we are targeting Parrot IM at everybody. Not just internet or tech savvy youngsters, but to anybody in the world that wants a superior online communication service.
  1. Feature List
    * To get a picture of what Parrot IM can do, have a look at our initial feature list.
  1. Behind the Scenes
    * Up to now, all of this has been talk. Anybody can dream about the perfect messaging client, but it takes significant planning and correct software engineering practices to make it reality.
  1. Who is making it?
    * We are a team called Pirate Captains. We consist of ten, equally budding software engineers. We have different skill sets, but neither of us is more senior than anybody else.
    * With a unique team such as this, it is paramount to have great team organization to get things done effectively.
  1. Team Organization
    * First, let's have a look at what this project requires.
    * We need a variety of skills in Communication protocols, Database design, GUI, and Quality Assurance frameworks.
    * With such a large team, it is wise to divide ourselves into the areas that we can contribute most in. Therefore, we have four subgroups that focus on each of these areas.
  1. Planning
    * With that said, we're not all going our separate ways and implementing our parts blindly. We realize that a Waterfall approach is not effective, in which we would first design and then code. Instead, we are mindful that things may change as we get further in the development cycle.
    * To deal with this, we are planning three phased releases, adding more features at each release. To ensure that our software meets the needs of users, we will reevaluate our design and specifications throughout the release schedule.
  1. Phased Releases
    * Here is our release schedule, with the plans for what we will release in each iteration.
  1. Potential Challenges
    * There are many challenges in working with such a large group.

    * Ask for questions.

## Introduction ##
  * Communication
    * Why make another chat client? There are already many programs that do the following:
      * have many users and have decent functionality (e.g. MSN, AOL, ICQ)
      * can work with multiple protocols (e.g. Trillian, Pidgin)
      * ... Twitter, Facebook, IRC...
    * Flaws in existing programs:
      * Some allow you to only communicate over one protocol
        * If you have friends that use different programs, you may not be able to communicate with each other
      * Do you trust your instant messenger?
        * Many clients are proprietary, and you have no way of knowing the source code
      * Confusing--too many buttons, but none of the buttons do what you want
        * Need a simple interface without sacrificing function
      * Customization
        * Certain more 'computer-literate' individuals often like to personalize their own software, instant messengers included
      * Most of them have ads and spywares
    * How we communicate...
      * Should be:
        * fun
        * easy
        * accessible
    * Can do better. We need a feature-rich, but easy-to-use, chat client that works with multiple protocols and operates efficiently. All of this should be open source.

## The Solution ##

  * We present: Parrot Instant Messenger
    * Main goals
      * easy to use - Running Parrot IM should allow you to chat to everyone who uses a computer. No technical skills should be required--the interface should be intuitive and clear.  Users shouldn't be made to navigate through a bunch of useless tabs, buttons, and flashy ads just to find the chat log button.
      * full of useful features - Want to let your friends know what you're doing, but don't want to announce it to the world? Get the Chatbot to tell them for you! Forgot where you're supposed to meet your friend? Don't parse the chat logs with your eyes! Search for "friday meet Alice where" and find out in less than a second. Parrot IM can do anything you need, but will not complicate your chatting.
      * be enjoyable! - Chatting in real life is fun. Why should it be anything less on the computer? With Parrot IM, you have all the tools you need at your fingertips to express yourself. You do not need a technical background to use our software.

    * Refer to architectural diagram, talk about individual features

## Behind the Scenes ##

  * What's in a name; why Parrot IM?
    * You can teach a parrot to say anything in any language. Parrot IM is similar in that you can use it to do many things; you do not need to rely on an array of programs to talk to your friends.
    * Parrots are attractive, and so is our user interface. Chatting is more than just protocols and text.

  * Who is responsible for creating Parrot IM?
    * Well, Pirates, of course!
    * Talk about our group.
      * All learning to be software engineers.
      * Group organized into subgroups, but everyone has an equal voice
