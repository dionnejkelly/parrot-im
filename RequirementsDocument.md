# Introduction #

The Parrot IM program is a new, easy-to-use, fun, and feature-rich instant messaging program that is compatible with multiple protocols, including XMPP, to target any age and audience. The program is aim to provide a simple, yet powerful, communication program that will allow many users to enjoy their conversations as naturally as if they were talking face-to-face.

The program is expected to implement all of our proposed features, including the low-priority features, by Parrot IM's final release. Also, the program is expected to provide services to users who will run Parrot IM whenever they wish to be connected to their friends and that they will prefer to run Parrot IM over existing messaging solutions, such as ICQ and Google Talk.

<br>
Metrics for specifying non-functional requirements:<br>
<br>
<h3>The Non-functional Requirements Table</h3>
<table><thead><th> Property </th><th> Measure </th></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> Speed    </td><td> User/Event response time. Messages should be sent within 1 second, and then it will be received by the user as long as their connection is currently stable. The program will execute, and the log-in window will show within 8 seconds on any computer of a Pentium 4 class or higher, or around 1 GHz of CPU capability. Parrot IM will log-in on all selected networks in maximum 30 seconds before the connection times out. Ideally, the client will log-in under 10 seconds. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Size     </td><td> Hard disk Requirements = The program will take up to 20 MB on the computer's hard drive to function all the features of Parrot IM that includes storing users' profile and their preference, sound notification, and images. <br> Memory Requirements = The program will occupy between 10 MB and 30 MB of RAM while running. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Ease of Use </td><td> Training time = A user who has had no exposure to other instant messaging programs will learn to create a user profile, log-in, add friends, and chat with their friends within 1 hour of training from the Parrot instructor. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Reliability </td><td> Mean time to failure = The number of faults found during testing (i.e., before delivery) will be no more than 50 based upon programmer information regarding failures found before release of the software. The failures (or other problems) reported by users after delivery will be no more than 20 based upon customer information regarding failures found after release of the software. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Robustness </td><td> Time to restart after failure = The program will take up to 15 seconds to restart after a software failure. <br> Percentage of events causing failure  = 2% of internal (i.e., incorrect input data)/external (i.e., power failure)/events causing software failure. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Portability </td><td> Can be used on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating environments. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Security </td><td> All stored passwords are encrypted inside the database. </td></tr></tbody></table>
