After you've logged in, you will see your main Friend List, which shows all of your friends you can chat with. This tutorial will instruct you on how to initiate a conversation with a friend.

1. From the Friend List, double-click on one of the online friends in your list. In the screenshot above, if you want to talk to "PersonB", simply double click his name, and a Chat Window will appear.

The Chat Window has three main components:
  * Chat history - The upper-right part of the window shows all your chat history with your friend for this session's chat. Everything that you both say is recorded here. In the screenshot, the chat history between PersonA and PersonB is being recorded.
  * Chat box - The bottom-right part of the window allows you to type messages to your friend. Anything you type in here will be sent after clicking the Send button or pressing enter. After being sent, it will show in the chat history area, above.
  * Current conversations - The left-hand side of the window shows all the friends that you are currently chatting with. If you have multiple conversations at the same time, your friends' names will appear in this column. To type to another friend, or see what they have typed to you, simply click their name. After somebody sends you a new message, their name will flash so to alert you of the new message.

2. To send messages to your friend, click the empty box in the bottom-right part of the screen, type your message, and then click the send button or press enter.

3. Messages to and from your friend will appear above this space, in the upper-right part of the window.

4. To finish your conversation, simply close the window. One way to do this is to click File --> close.

5. Your friend will not be alerted that you closed the window, but the chat history will be removed from your screen.

6. If your friend says anything else to you, the Chat Window will appear again, and you'll see his or her message.
