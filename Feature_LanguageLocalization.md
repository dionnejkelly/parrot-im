The menus and text in Parrot IM can be changed to whichever language you prefer. Upon installation, the language will default to the computer's default language, but can be changed in the options menu. On release, the following languages will be supported:
  * English
  * Chinese
  * Korean
  * Arabic
  * Indonesian

Additionally, we will implement other languages with the help of other users.
