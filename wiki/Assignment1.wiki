== About Our Project ==
 * Open Source License: [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html GNU General Public License v2.0]
    * This license essentially guarantees that the program is and always will be free to run, and that its source code is free to view and modify. The license serves in both (a) copyrighting the software, and (b) allowing anybody to copy, distribute, and modify the program's code. However, if an organization uses this program privately, then the license does not force the organization to publicly release the executable or source code; this is one of the minor differences between GPL v2.0 and GPL v3.0. Furthermore, it is permissible to charge a fee for the act of physically transferring a copy, but illegal to charge for the copy itself. If released as an executable file, the program must have its source code released, also. Finally, the license must persist in future iterations of the code, even if transferred to other projects.
    * The following must be present in all source code for the program: 
{{{
// Parrot IM -- An easy-to-use and feature-rich chat client for multiple protocols.

    * Additionally, a message must display during interactive use of the program that indicates the program is covered under this license.
