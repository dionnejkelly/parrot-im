#summary Feature: Twitter and ICQ Protocols

Parrot IM can connect you to friends from a variety of different instant messaging networks or social networking websites, including ICQ and Twitter. To add a friend from one of these networks, simply select either ICQ or Twitter for the protocol type in the Add a Friend Window. After doing so, the window will ask you to type in the required information about your friend to connect you to him or her. For example, if you are adding a Twitter user to your Friend List, you will need to know the username of your friend, whereas if you are adding an ICQ friend you will input his or her account number instead. After adding your friends, they will all show in the Friend List. Different chat networks may allow you to communicate with your friends differently. Twitter friends, for example, will show their latest status in the status pane of the page, and any message you send to them will be sent to their Twitter inbox. The Parrot IM user interface will direct you on how to communicate with each friend.
