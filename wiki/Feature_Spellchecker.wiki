#summary Feature: Spellchecker

As you type to your friends in the Chat Window, a red underline will appear under words that are not in Parrot IM's dictionary. This will notify you that either (a) you spelled the word wrong, or (b) that you used a word not in the dictionary, and you can then add it if you desire. If the word is not in the dictionary, you can right-click the underlined word and a list of suggested words will appear. The spellchecker helps you proof-read your messages to help you communicate as accurately to your friends as possible.
