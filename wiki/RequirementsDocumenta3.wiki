[Feature_GUI Graphical Graphical User Interface]: No change. Implemented.

[Feature_FriendList Friend List]: The Friend List is currently set to show the online status of the user, and indicates whether the friends are away, busy, offline, or blocked. The list is sorted alphabetically, but users that are more online than others receive higher priority at the top of the list. We do not have search function yet. GUI is provided.
