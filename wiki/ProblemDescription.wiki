==Project Background:==
 * This project is aiming to create a completely featured communication client, such as MSN, ICQ, Twitter. Also, this communication client should be able to combine other communication tools. The ultimate goal of this project is that this communication client should be error free, full-featured and everybody in the world should be able to use it anytime anywhere. However, the ultimate goal is hard to reach because some problems, such as time issue, team issue and some technical issues. So, the basic goal of this project is to create a completely featured communication client for the users and ensure the basic function of this communication client work smoothly.   
==Stakeholders:==
 * Our programming team members
 * The Parror-IM client who wants the software to be completed
 * Users that use the software as a means of entertainment and an extensible instant messaging  
==Users:==
 * The users of our feature-rich instant messaging program that is compatible with multiple protocols, including XMPP, are available to everyone who would like to use our software. Our software is meant to provide an easy-to-use and friendly instant messaging program that allows the users to share their conversation with other registered users.

  * Our team members having passion and eagerness to throughly complete this project.
  * Our team members putting a maximum effort to finish the project.
  * Our team members understanding more about the software development as we go along with the project.
  * Our team members assuming that the software will provide a completely featured communication client.
 
 * *The client:*
  * The client is assuming that the project is capable of implementing the specficiations.
  * The client is assuming that the project will be thoroughly completed within the due date.
  * The client is assuming that the users will enjoy using our software.
 * *The users:* 
  * The users are assuming that the program will provide a feature-rich instant messaging program that is compatible with multiple protocols.
  * The users are assuming that the program will be updated occasionally with new features and bug-free software.
  * The users are assuming that the software is not harmful or provoke any negative effects to influence their health or behaviors.
