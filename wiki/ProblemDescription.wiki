==Project Background:==
 * This project is aiming to create a completely featured communication client, such as MSN, ICQ, Twitter. Also, this communication client should be able to combine other communication tools. The ultimate goal of this project is that this communication client should be error free, full-featured and everybody in the world should be able to use it anytime anywhere. However, the ultimate goal is hard to reach because some problems, such as time issue, team issue and some technical issues. So, the basic goal of this project is to create a completely featured communication client for the users and ensure the basic function of this communication client work smoothly.   
==Stakeholders:==
 * Our programming team members
 * The Parror-IM client who wants the software to be completed
 * Users that use the software as a means of entertainment and an extensible instant messaging  
==Users:==
 * The users of our feature-rich instant messaging program that is compatible with multiple protocols, including XMPP, are available to everyone who would like to use our software. Our software is meant to provide an easy-to-use and friendly instant messaging program that allows the users to share their conversation with other registered users.
