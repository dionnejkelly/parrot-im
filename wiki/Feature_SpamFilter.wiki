#summary Feature: Spam Filter

One complaint that users have about some existing programs is that they often receive spam messages from people they don't know.  Parrot IM implements a spam filter in two ways to prevent this from happening. Only friends on your list are permitted to send you messages. Any messages originating from strangers will trigger Parrot IM to show a notification in your Friend List that shows the name of the sender, which you can either block or accept. This way, spam messages do not automatically get sent to you, but they aren't automatically deleted either in case they are actually not spam.
