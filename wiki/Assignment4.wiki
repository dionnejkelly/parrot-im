= Testing Report =

Testing for the Beta released consisted of three parts:

== Unit Testing ==

The low-level data types were checked for consistency, and each method was verified to return the expected results and make state changes to the objects as expected. The test cases are as follows:

|| *Filename* || *Components Tested* ||
|| !AccountDataTest.java || data consistency, adding friends, removing friends, searching for friends ||
|| !AccountTempDataTest.java || data consistency ||
|| !ChatbotTest || response generation, response triggering, enabler ||
|| !ChatlogMessageTempDataTest || data consistency ||
|| !ConversationDataTest || data consistency, message retrieval, message formatting, message storage ||
|| !CurrentProfileDataTest || data consistency, adding accounts, removing friends, getting friend list ||
|| !GoogleTalkUserData || data consistency ||
|| !JabberUserData || data consistency ||
|| !TwitterUserData || data consistency ||
|| !MessageDataTest || data consistency, message manipulation, message retrieval ||
|| !ServerTypeTest || utility methods for enumerated type ||
|| !UserDataTest || inheritance test, data consistency ||

*Results:*

Development of unit test cases allowed us to remove redundant code and add more robust methods to our low-level data. For instance, the Quality Assurance team identified methods that effectively did the same task, and merged them into one. 

Another important find was that the search functions were comparing based on an equals method inherited by the Object class. Essentially, two !UserData or !AccountData objects were treated as equal only if they had the same reference; not if their data was equal. This posed subtle problems for removing or checking for the existence of these objects. As The equals() method was overridden as a result of the test cases.

Furthermore, these tests will be conducted and updated as our low-level data types under go upgrades in future revisions of the program.

All the test cases have successfully passed the test. We have tested most of the code using JUnit but some of the code wasn't tested or the test isn't completed and I include the reason for each one:

*DatabaseFunctions:* We had problems testing it by JUnit, and we couldn't figure out the reason. So, we included database testing in the integration test phase.

*GUI, sounds, Spell checker and Dictionary:* It's more difficult to test those classes using unit testing. So, we tested this by integration and manual testing.

== Reports from JUnit test cases  ==

Here are three examples for result from JUnit testing:

The green line and green labels on the methods mean that methods,(or when also the test case are labeled green) are successful and no errors have occured according to test case alogrithms. If the test case are labeled blue this means there were an error according to test case (mostly logical) for example in our DatabasefunctionsTest class, it gives failure to some functions eventhough it works in practice (that's why we didn't fully implemented DatabaseFunctionsTest). When methods are labeled red, this means that there were an error in processing the function itself (syntax error, initialization error) and complier stops the testing for the method in this case. 

== Integration Testing ==

We employed two main integration steps to test Parrot IM. First, we integrated the Database and the Model, and checked both for consistencies while accessing and mutating data. Next, we integrated the Controller class, and performed a functional test which in turn integrated the lower-level components of the system, namely the Model and the Database.

  * !ModelToDatabaseTest.java
    * Checks for consistency between the model and the database. The only location in which the database can be called is the model. We mainly checked for consistency in dealing with duplicate input.
  * XMPPTest.java
    * Executes functions to mimic user interaction with Parrot IM. All calls come from the MainController class, which currently only supports XMPP functions. The Model and Database are, again, involved in processing the requests. The integrity of both are checked also.

*Results:*
Integration testing was useful in organizing and cleaning up the code. In designing, it was not completely clear which components of the program handled certain things. For instance, is it the controller, model, or database's job to deal with duplicate account additions? Is it all of them? Integration testing showed errors when we didn't handle these situations properly. Ultimately, the testing made us set a focus to handle data integrity, the Model.

Also, integration testing of the controller was first to show [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=22 Issue 22]. The XMPPTest.java class attempted to add and remove dummy accounts from our userIDs, and this bug manifested itself. If it weren't for this testing, we may have found this bug out at a later, more crucial time in development. Also, the test confirmed that it was the server at fault, not our controller, GUI, model, or database.

In this phase, we tried to make sure that everything works well in practice. This includes testing the following:

1. All the features are working properly without any errors or crashing.

2. Database retuns correct data.

3. Consistent GUI for easy-to-use interface.

We acheived the testing by following a simple tasks that users normally do. We put a table that include the procedures, observations on testing the task, and the expected output based on our features document:

|| *Task* || *Observation* || *Expected result* ||
|| Signing in || It takes around 10 seconds to login. || Users are able to sign in within 8 seconds on any computer of a Pentium 4 class or higher, or around 1 GHz of CPU capability.||
|| Signing out || Program signs out all users within 1 second. || Users are able to sign out within 1 second.||
|| Signing out, Signing in again || Users are able to flexibly sign-in and sign-out at any time. || Users are able to sign in and out multiple times. ||
|| Adding a buddy|| Users are able to add a buddy within 3 seconds. || When adding a buddy, it takes 3 seconds. ||
|| Removing a buddy|| Users are able to removea user within 2 seconds. || Users have no problem removing a buddy, and the buddy will be removed from the database. ||
|| Blocking a buddy|| Users can organize the list of blocked buddies by blocking a buddy within 2 seconds.|| Users are able to see the blocked buddies both in the buddy list and the blocked manager.  || 
|| Unblocking a buddy|| Users are able to unblock a buddy within 2 seconds.||  Users are able to unblock a buddythrough the buddy list and the blocked manager. ||
|| Viewing Chat log || Shows the previous chat history organized by users' account. || You can view chatlog, and search conversations. ||
|| Connected buddies|| Inconsistent number of connected buddies. || Number of connected buddiesshould be displayed consistently. ||
|| Changing a personal status|| Users are able to change their states effectively. || Users are able to change their states both in the buddylist and the option.||
|| Changing a personal avator picture || Users are able to change their avatar pictures effectively||  Users are able to change their avatar pictures both in the buddylist and the option.||
|| Chating with a friend || Users are able to chat flexibly with a buddy. ||  Users are able to chat flexibly with a buddy in a chat or conference room. ||
|| Pressing Enter to send || Sending a message by pressing Enter takes no more than 1 second to process. ||  Users are able to send a message instantly. ||


== User Acceptance Testing ==

For the alpha release, each member asked friends and family members to try out Parrot IM. In some cases, we did an ethnographic test, in which we directly observed the user's interaction with our system, and noted which areas of the program seemed to be difficult for them to access. Also, we observed the tendencies of users to perform certain tasks while using our program. 

Additionally, we asked some testers to try out Parrot IM alone, and they reported back on any challenges they had or features they'd like changed or added. We also instructed these users to try to do certain tasks, such as adding a friend, or using the chat log, and report back on the experience.

GUI Testing and acceptance steps:

1. We asked 10 users to try and run our software.

2. We asked them to do the following tasks while one of the team is loggin with cmpt275testing@gmail.com

a) Register with your !GoogleTalk account

b) Add cmpt275testing@gmail.com

c) Send cmpt275testing a message

d) Wait for a message coming for cmpt275testing

e) (cmpt275 will sign out) send a message to chatbot and ask him "What is your name?" and "What is up!" and wait for his respond

f) block cmpt275testing (cmpt275testing will sign again and he should not find user)

g) delete cmpt275 testing

h) log out

*Observations:*
  * User got confused with the idea of profile and account. Probably the GUI is confusing.
  * User felt good about the sign in window, but they thought the buddy list is a  little bit simple.
  * User got confused with the block user icon, because they thought that icon is not clear.
  * User got could not figure out how to unblock an account.
  * User did not like the design of the Help window.
  * User did not like the fact that he can't find out which account he's logged into while logged on, only the profile.
  * User did not like the Help/About Parrot.IM link opening right on top of the main window, causing a confusing effect.
  * Didn't like buttons with icons not having tooltips.
  * Didn't like text formatting buttons not changing the text in the input box
  * Add a buddy asked for an "Input", not user friendly.
  * Didn't like message box having a delay after pressing enter to clear the box.
  * When opening a conversation, the keyboard input should be focused on the text input field.
  * Wanted an indicator for signing it. Currently it looks like it's frozen when logging in.
  * Exiting Buddy list with File->Exit doesn't also close the chat window.
  * Wanted a Account Setup wizard to open on first run of the program.


*Future Plans:*
  * Need to improve the GUI so the user can easily distinguish profile and account.
  * I think we need to impove the view of the buddy list in the Beta version.
  * We should make the block friend icon as clear as the add friend and remove friend icon. 
  * Need to make a sleeker Help window.
  * Show which account is talking to each friend in Conversation Window.
  * Move Help/About Parrot.IM link a bit down and to the right.
  * The display picture should have a tooltip saying it's actully clickable to pop the file browser.

= Known Bugs =

== Critical Priority ==

  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=22 Issue 22]
    * Adding and remove friends used to work fine. However, after a period, certain accounts would give the errors detailed in the issue above, making adding and removing friends impossible. It appears to be an error with the smack API, and it is impossible to recover from the exception it throws.
    * Was uncovered with integration testing using the XMPPTest test case.

== Medium Priority ==
  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=9 Issue 9]
    * Exception thrown from an unknown source 50% of the time when receiving a message. No other effects seen.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=10 Issue 10]
    * Exception thrown from an unknown source 25% of the time when logging in. No other effects seen.

== Integration Testing ==

== User Interface Testing ==

We included this test with user accptance test. It tests our product in how:

1. It uses terms that is easy for the user to comprehend

2. Interface is consistent, that's it do similar things for similar operations

3. It's minimal, it doesn't do surprise the user. It do what the user expect it to do.

4. User can recover from errors such as blocking a friend, or removing a friend by mistake

5. It provide help and warnings to the user such as Help tab

6. The user can interact with the interface the way he/she prefer

Observations on User Interface:



== User Acceptance Testing ==
We asked the following 20 users to test our product and do the following tasks, and that by observing them while they talk about the problems with the interface(Natural observation). Here are the tasks:

1. Sign in and out

2. Add a friend, "cmpt275testing"

3. Block a friend

4. Unblock a friend

5. Remove a friend

6. Add the removed friend

7. Search for a user "cmpt275testing" in your search bar

8. Send a message

9. See if friend is typing and wait for the message

10. Change your avatour picture, state and statues

11. Other user will tell you if you change it

12. Enalbe Chatbot and "cmpt275testing" will talk to your chatbot
