= Testing Report =

Testing for the Beta released consisted of three parts:

== Unit Testing ==

We have used Eclipse 3.4.2 and JUnit 4.0 to write our unit and integration test cases. The low-level data types were checked for consistency, and each method was verified to return the expected results and make state changes to the objects as expected. The test cases are as follows:

|| *Filename* || *Components Tested* ||
|| !AccountDataTest.java || data consistency, adding friends, removing friends, searching for friends ||
|| !AccountTempDataTest.java || data consistency ||
|| !ChatbotTest || response generation, response triggering, enabler ||
|| !ChatlogMessageTempDataTest || data consistency ||
|| !ConversationDataTest || data consistency, message retrieval, message formatting, message storage ||
|| !CurrentProfileDataTest || data consistency, adding accounts, removing friends, getting friend list ||
|| !GoogleTalkUserData || data consistency ||
|| !JabberUserData || data consistency ||
|| !TwitterUserData || data consistency ||
|| !MessageDataTest || data consistency, message manipulation, message retrieval ||
|| !ServerTypeTest || utility methods for enumerated type ||
|| !UserDataTest || inheritance test, data consistency ||

*Results:*

Development of unit test cases allowed us to remove redundant code and add more robust methods to our low-level data. For instance, the Quality Assurance team identified methods that effectively did the same task, and merged them into one. 

Another important find was that the search functions were comparing based on an equals method inherited by the Object class. Essentially, two !UserData or !AccountData objects were treated as equal only if they had the same reference; not if their data was equal. This posed subtle problems for removing or checking for the existence of these objects. As The equals() method was overridden as a result of the test cases.

Furthermore, these tests will be conducted and updated as our low-level data types under go upgrades in future revisions of the program.

All the test cases have successfully passed the test. We have tested most of the code using JUnit but some of the code wasn't tested or the test isn't completed and I include the reason for each one:

*DatabaseFunctions:* We had problems testing it by JUnit, and we couldn't figure out the reason. So, we included database testing in the integration test phase.

*GUI, sounds, Spell checker and Dictionary:* It's more difficult to test those classes using unit testing. So, we tested this by integration and manual testing.

== Reports from JUnit test cases  ==

Here are three examples for result from JUnit testing:

The green line and green labels on the methods mean that methods,(or when also the test case are labeled green) are successful and no errors have occured according to test case alogrithms. If the test case are labeled blue this means there were an error according to test case (mostly logical) for example in our DatabasefunctionsTest class, it gives failure to some functions eventhough it works in practice (that's why we didn't fully implemented DatabaseFunctionsTest). When methods are labeled red, this means that there were an error in processing the function itself (syntax error, initialization error) and complier stops the testing for the method in this case. 

== Integration Testing ==

We employed two main integration steps to test Parrot IM. First, we integrated the Database and the Model, and checked both for consistencies while accessing and mutating data. Next, we integrated the Controller class, and performed a functional test which in turn integrated the lower-level components of the system, namely the Model and the Database.

  * !ModelToDatabaseTest.java
    * Checks for consistency between the model and the database. The only location in which the database can be called is the model. We mainly checked for consistency in dealing with duplicate input.
  * MainController.java
    * Executes functions to mimic user interaction with Parrot IM. All calls come from the this main controller class, which currently only supports XMPP and Twitter functions. The Model and Database are, again, involved in processing the requests. The integrity of both are checked also.


== User Interface Testing ==

We included this test with user accptance test. It tests our product in how:

1. It uses terms that is easy for the user to comprehend

2. Interface is consistent, that's it do similar things for similar operations

3. It's minimal, it doesn't do surprise the user. It do what the user expect it to do.

4. User can recover from errors such as blocking a friend, or removing a friend by mistake

5. It provide help and warnings to the user such as Help tab

6. The user can interact with the interface the way he/she prefer


*Results:*
Integration testing was useful in organizing and cleaning up the code. In designing, it was not completely clear which components of the program handled certain things. For instance, is it the controller, model, or database's job to deal with duplicate account additions? Is it all of them? Integration testing showed errors when we didn't handle these situations properly. Ultimately, the testing made us set a focus to handle data integrity, the Model.

In this phase, we tried to make sure that everything works well in practice. This includes testing the following:

1. All the features are working properly without any errors or crashing.

2. Database retuns correct data.

3. Consistent GUI for easy-to-use interface.

We acheived the testing by following a simple tasks that users normally do. We put a table that include the procedures, observations on testing the task, and the expected output based on our features document:

|| *Task* || *Observation* || *Expected result* ||
|| Signing in || It takes around 10 seconds to login. || Users are able to sign in within 8 seconds on any computer of a Pentium 4 class or higher, or around 1 GHz of CPU capability.||
|| Signing out || Program signs out all users within 1 second. || Users are able to sign out within 1 second.||
|| Signing out, Signing in again || Users are able to flexibly sign-in and sign-out at any time. || Users are able to sign in and out multiple times. ||
|| Adding a buddy|| Users are able to add a buddy within 3 seconds. || When adding a buddy, it takes 3 seconds. ||
|| Removing a buddy|| Users are able to removea user within 2 seconds. || Users have no problem removing a buddy, and the buddy will be removed from the database. ||
|| Blocking a buddy|| Users can organize the list of blocked buddies by blocking a buddy within 2 seconds.|| Users are able to see the blocked buddies both in the buddy list and the blocked manager.  || 
|| Unblocking a buddy|| Users are able to unblock a buddy within 2 seconds.||  Users are able to unblock a buddythrough the buddy list and the blocked manager. ||
|| Viewing Chat log || Shows the previous chat history organized by users' account. || You can view chatlog, and search conversations. ||
|| Connected buddies|| Inconsistent number of connected buddies. || Number of connected buddiesshould be displayed consistently. ||
|| Changing a personal status|| Users are able to change their states effectively. || Users are able to change their states both in the buddylist and the option.||
|| Changing a personal avator picture || Users are able to change their avatar pictures effectively||  Users are able to change their avatar pictures both in the buddylist and the option.||
|| Chating with a friend || Users are able to chat flexibly with a buddy. ||  Users are able to chat flexibly with a buddy in a chat or conference room. ||
|| Pressing Enter to send || Sending a message by pressing Enter takes no more than 1 second to process. ||  Users are able to send a message instantly. ||


== User Acceptance Testing ==

For the beta release, each member asked friends and family members to try out Parrot IM. In some cases, we did an ethnographic test, in which we directly observed the user's interaction with our system, and noted which areas of the program seemed to be difficult for them to access. Also, we observed the tendencies of users to perform certain tasks while using our program. 

Additionally, we asked some testers to try out Parrot IM alone, and they reported back on any challenges they had or features they'd like changed or added. We also instructed these users to try to do certain tasks, such as adding a friend, or using the chat log, and report back on the experience.

GUI Testing and acceptance steps:

We have asked the following 20 users to test our program and do the following tasks. By carefully observing them while they interacted with our program, we have noticed the users' tendency of their natural reaction to certain interfaces. The tasks included were:


1. We asked 20 users to try and run our software.

2. We asked them to do the following tasks while one of the team is logged in with cmpt275testing@gmail.com

 * a) Create a personal profile

 * b) Register with your !GoogleTalk account

 * c) Sign in with the profile

 * d) Add cmpt275testing@gmail.com

 * e) Enable Chat Log

 * f) Send cmpt275testing a message

 * g) Wait for a message coming for cmpt275testing

 * h) Create a conference room

 * i) Invite cmpt275testing to that conference room

 * j) Send a message to the conference room

 * k) Wait for cmpt275testing's reponse

 * l) See if your friend is typing and wait for the message

 * m) Type a mispelled word.

 * n) Send a small file to cmpt275testing.

 * o) Wait for the file acceptance. 

 * p) Enalbe Chatbot and "cmpt275testing" will talk to your chatbot

 * q) (cmpt275 will sign out) send a message to chatbot and ask him "What is your name?" and "What is up!" and wait for his respond
 * r) Disable chatbot and talks to "cmpt275testing"'s chatbot

 * s) Change your personal avatar picture, state and statues

 * t) Search for a user "cmpt275testing" in your search bar

 * u) Check Chat Log

 * v) Search Chat Log by typing cmpt275testing

 * w) Sign out


3. We asked them to do the following tasks while one of the team is logged in with cmpt275testing on Twitter

 * a) Create a personal profile

 * b) Register with your !Twitter account

 * c) Sign in with the profile

 * d) Add a twitter friend

 * e) Remove a friend

 * f) Send a message to your twitter friend

 * g) Set your status

 * h) Send a bug report

 * i) Enable Sound Notifcation

 * j) Disable Sound Notifcation

 * j) Go to help menu and click

 * k) Do google search by typing in the text field


*Observations:*
    * User felt good about the sign in window and they thought the buddy list was well organized.
  * User did not like the design of the bug report window.
  * User did not like the fact that he can't find out which account he's logged into while logged on, only the profile.
  * User did not like the About Parrot.IM link opening right on top of the main window, causing a confusing effect.
  * Didn't like text formatting buttons not changing the text in the input box
  * Add a buddy asked for an "Input", not user friendly.
  * Didn't like message box having a delay after pressing enter to clear the box.
  * When opening a conversation, the keyboard input should be focused on the text input field.
  * Wanted an indicator for signing it. Currently it looks like it's frozen when logging in.



*Future Plans:*
  * Need to improve the GUI for managing multiple accounts withint one profile so the user can easily distinguish multiple accounts.
  * I think we need to impove the view of the buddy list in the Final version.
  * Move Help/About Parrot.IM link a bit down and to the right.

== Critical Priority ==

  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=61 Issue 61]
    * Changing fonts, size, font size, bold, italic, underlnie, and font color used to work fine. However, after a period, the object type of the text field were changed and became non functional as detailed in the issue above, making text editiing impossible. It appears to be an error with the changing in the text object.
    * Was uncovered with user acceptance testing with the helpful comments from the users.

== Medium Priority ==
  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=56 Issue 56]
    * Exception thrown from an unknown source 50% of the time when logging and being neutral. No other effects seen.
