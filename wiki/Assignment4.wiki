== Testing ==

To validate our product, we did the following phases:

== Unit Testing ==
We used Eclipse 3.4.2 and JUnit 4.0 to write our test cases.
To see our results you have two options:

1. Import from SVN

a) Download Eclipse 3.4.2

b) Open Eclipse

c) Select Help tab

d) Go to Software update

e) Import from following site: http//subclipse.tigirs.org/update1_4x (if you don't have SVN downloaded yet)

f) Download required and recommended features (you can have a problem with downloading optional features) then just go on until it's downloaded

g) Select File tab

h) Select import

i) Select SVN and import repesitory

j) import from the site : https//parrot-im.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

k) download parrot-im

l) run test cases in test,unittest, beta test (anyway I think we need to put everything in one package)

2. Copy paste

a) Download eclipse 3.4.2

b) Download JUnit 4.0 (include http)

c) Copy test cases into eclipse and run tests

All the test cases has succesfuly passed the test. We test most of the code using JUnit but some of the code wasn't tested or the test isn't completed and I include the reason for each one:

DatabaseFunctions: We had problems testing it by JUnit, and we couldn't figure out the reason. So, we included database testing in the integration test phase.

GUI, sounds, Spell checker and Dictionary: It's more difficult to test those classes using unit testing. So, we tested this by integration and manual testing.

== Integration Testing ==

In this phase, we tried to make sure that everything works well practically. This include testing that:

1. All the features are working fine, without any crashes

2. Database retuns correct data

3. GUI don't have any inconsistent problems

We did the testing, by doing tasks typicall users do. We put a table that include tasks, observations on testing the task, and the expected output based on our features document:
