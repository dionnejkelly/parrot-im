#summary Feature: Chatbot

The Chatbot is a tool that can reply to friends on your behalf. To enable it, click on the Use Chatbot button in the Chat Window. If enabled, the Chatbot will automatically reply to your friends with messages that are designed to simulate an intelligent conversation with other human users. For example, you can set the Chatbot to send specific away messages to tell your friends when you'll be back.

Additionally, the Chatbot can interpret the messages your friends send you and reply with useful information. For instance, suppose you are a student. You can set the Chatbot to reply with the class you are currently taking when your friend sends the words, "what class". In this example, the Chatbot will look at a daily schedule that you previously provided it, and use the current time to intelligently respond to your friends with helpful information. You can set the bot to detect other keywords and reply with any message you want.
