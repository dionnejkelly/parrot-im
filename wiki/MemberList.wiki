  * 2nd year Software Systems Computer Science
  * I started off here doing Mechatronics Engineering, but realizing my lack of interest in physics was not a very good thing <br> I landed myself into computer science since programming was more my thing.  So far in terms of programming languages <br> I've used C++ and Java, I've also done a little bit of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in elective IAT courses.  I also consider myself <br> a decent writer if the Documentation department requires help.
