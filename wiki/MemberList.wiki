  * 2nd year of Computing Science
  * I am fluent in Python, Java, and C. I have also been practicing C++ recently, and understand how Object Oriented Programming works in C++. My area of interest is User Interface, but lately I am starting to be interested in InterProcess Communication (IPC). I have done a proposal regarding software development, hopefully that will be helpful for our project.

* Aaron Siu *
  * contact: khs2@sfu.ca msn: nubpotato@hotmail.com
  * 2nd year Software Systems Computer Science
  * I started off here doing Mechatronics Engineering, but realizing my lack of interest in physics was not a very good thing <br> I landed myself into computer science since programming was more my thing.  So far in terms of programming languages <br> I've used C++ and Java, I've also done a little bit of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in elective IAT courses.  I also consider myself <br> a decent writer if the Documentation department requires help.
