  * I am proficient in C/C++ and Java. I have so far taken CMPT 126, 150, and 225 at SFU. I have also taken non-transferrable computing science classes from a previous school that roughly covered the same content. I have always had an interest in software engineering--how a large group of talented people can create programs that would be impossible to code alone.

* Aaron Siu *
  * contact: khs2@sfu.ca msn: nubpotato@hotmail.com
  * Student number: 301065638
  * 2nd year Software Systems Computer Science
  * I started off here doing Mechatronics Engineering, but realizing my lack of interest in physics was not a very good thing <br> I landed myself into computer science since programming was more my thing.  So far in terms of programming languages <br> I've used C++ and Java, I've also done a little bit of photoshop graphics, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in elective IAT courses.  I also consider myself <br> a decent writer if the Documentation department requires help.

  * Student number: 301103937
  * Second Degree in Computing Science
  * I am a Second Degree Computing Science student and this semester is my 3rd semester in SFU. I have learned about programming language like VB, C/C++ and java. I desire to learn how to use a programming language or software in the real life. I think I will have the chance to learn more in this semester.
