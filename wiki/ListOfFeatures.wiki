#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

NOTE: Please provide at least a one-line summary for each feature that you add.

 * GUI
 * Chatbot
 * XMPP protocol
 * Tabbed windows
 * Friend list
 * Status
   Allows the user to set their status (i.e. available, busy, away, etc)
 * Chat log
   Allows the user to keep the history of each conversation
 * Block another user
   Allows the user to block other user(s) from contacting them
 * Chatroom/Conference 
   Allows the user to create their own chatroom so that they can talk to more than one users in the chatroom
 * File transfer
   Allows the user to send some files to another user
 * Customize UI
   Allows the user to choose the GUI depending on their preferences. In the early development, the user would be allowed to choose their favourite menu to be shown on the main window or choose the colour of the window, etc. In the later development, we might try to develop other GUI, so the user would have some options which GUI to use. (Can anyone expand this idea? Or is it too difficult to implant? If it is, then you can just remove this feature)
