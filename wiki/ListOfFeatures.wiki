#summary Features of Parrot-IM

NOTE: Please provide at least a one-line summary for each feature that you add.

= High Priority =
Must be implemented in first iteration of project.
 * GUI
   Working messaging interface, ie: type box, text output box
 * Friend list
   List that displays buddies
 * XMPP protocol
   the same protocol Google Talk used. Several servers and clients have support for this. Anyone can setup their own IM network using a XMPP server.
   ~~Messaging protocol to be decided, most likely MSN?~~
 * Live instant messaging
   Ability to hold a one-on-one conversation with a buddy on given protocol
 * Multiple Users
   Maintain a database to allow multiple users to log in, each with their unique friend lists.   
 * Modular Design or Plug-in system
   protocol, or network can be added easily without changing the core program
<hr>
= Medium Priority =
Would like to have done by final iteration.
 * Friend Groups
   Allows user to put their buddies into different groups on the friends list
 * File transfer
   Allows the user to send some files to another user
 * Status
   Allows the user to set their status (i.e. available, busy, away, etc)
 * Block another user
   Allows the user to block other user(s) from contacting them
 * Add/Remove another user
   Allows the user to add or remove new contacts
 * Chatroom/Conference 
   Allows the user to create their own chatroom so that they can talk to more than one 
 * Chat log
   Allows the user to keep the history of each conversation users in the chatroom
 * Customize Font
   Allows user to change size, family, and colour of their typing font.
 * Sound Notification
   Play a short sound clip upon certain events occurring, such as receiving a message.
 * Search
   Allows user to efficiently and intuitively search previous conversations for anything.

<hr>
= Low Priority =
Will do when if we have extra time.
 * Customize UI
   Allows the user to choose the GUI depending on their preferences. In the early development, the user would be allowed to choose their favourite menu to be shown on the main window or choose the colour of the window, etc. In the later development, we might try to develop other GUI, so the user would have some options which GUI to use. (Can anyone expand this idea? Or is it too difficult to implement? If it is, then you can just remove this feature)
 * Additional Protocol Modules
   Optional software modules that allows adding accounts from different instant messaging protocols and login simultaneously
<hr>

- Features Dump

 * Chatbot
   Automatic response systems (ie. away messages)
   like a answering machine
 * Tabbed windows
   Collapse multiple conversations into a single window separated into tabs
 * Multiple networks
   Allows user to log in into different networks (ie. log in into YM and MSN using the application)
 * Profile system
   users can create their own profiles. Every profile is password-protected. It stores the configuration and also the account and the password of different IM network users setup. so the program can login to several IM network once it's launched.
 * Offline messaging
   Allows user to leave messages to another user(s).
