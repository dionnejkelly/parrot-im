= High Priority (6) =
*Note:* Must be implemented in the first iteration of project.
 * *GUI* - friendly graphical user interface that allows the users to interact with the program with their keyboard and mouse (i.e. type box, text output box).
 * *Friend List* - tracks the list of users' friends, family, co-workers, and associates in an organized manner. 
 * *XMPP Protocol* - the same protocol as Google Talk has used. Several servers and clients have support for this. Anyone can setup their own IM network using a XMPP server.
   ~~Messaging protocol to be decided, most likely MSN?~~
 * *Live Instant Messaging* - ability to hold a one-on-one conversation with a buddy on given protocol.
 * *Multiple Users* - maintain a database to allow multiple users to log in, each with their own unique friend lists.   
 * *Modular Design or Plug-in System* - protocol, or network can be easily added without changing the core program.
<hr>
= Medium Priority (11) =
*Note:* Hoping to complete this implementation by final iteration.
 * *Storing User Information* - allows users to save their username and password.
 * *Friend Groups* - allows users to organize their buddies into different groups on the friends list.
 * *File Transfer* - allows users to send their files to another user.
 * *Status* - allows users to set their status (i.e. available, busy, away, etc.).
 * *Blocking another user* - allows users to block other user(s) from contacting them.
 * *Add/Remove another user* - allows users to add or remove new contacts.
 * *Chatroom/Conference* - allows users to create their own chatroom for private conference with more than one user.
 * *Chat Log* - allows users to keep the history of each conversation in the chatroom.
 * *Font Customization* - allows users to customize font size, font, family, and colour of their typing font.
 * *Sound Notification* - plays a short sound clip upon certain events occurring, such as receiving a message.
 * *Search Engine* - allows users to efficiently and intuitively search previous conversations (temporary) for anything.

<hr>
= Low Priority (2) =
*Note:* Implemented if the time permits.
 * *UI Customization* - allows users to customize the GUI settings depending on their preferences. In the early development, the user would be allowed to choose their favourite menu to be shown on the main window or choose the colour or theme of the window, etc. In the later development, we might try to develop other GUI features, so the user would have some options which GUI to use. (Can anyone expand this idea? Or is it too difficult to implement? If it is, then you can just remove this feature)
 * *Additional Protocol Modules* - optional software modules that allows users to add accounts from different instant messaging protocols and login simultaneously.
<hr>

- Features Dump (8)
 * *Chatbot* - allows users to enable an auto-reply message that is designed to simulate an intelligent conversation with other human users (i.e. away messages).
 * *Tabbed Windows* - collapse multiple conversations into a single window separated into tabs.
 * *Multiple Networks* - allows users to log in into different networks (i.e. log in into YM and MSN using the application)
 * *Profile System* - allow users to create their own profiles. Every profile is secured by password-protection. It stores the configuration, the account ID and the password of different IM network users' profile. Therefore, the program allows users to login to several IM network once it's launched.
 * *Offline Messaging* - allows users to leave messages to another user(s).
 * *Right-click options* - right-click on the name of another user to access options such as remove/block contact, send file, start chatting, etc.
