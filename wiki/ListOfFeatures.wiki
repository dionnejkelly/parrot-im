Must be implemented in first iteration of project.

   List that displays buddies
 * XMPP protocol
   Messaging protocol to be decided, most likely MSN?

   Ability to hold a one-on-one conversation with a buddy on given protocol   
<hr>

Would like to have done by final iteration.

 * File transfer
   Allows the user to send some files to another user

= Low Priority =
Will do when if we have extra time.
 * Customize UI
   Allows the user to choose the GUI depending on their preferences. In the early development, the user would be allowed to choose their favourite menu to be shown on the main window or choose the colour of the window, etc. In the later development, we might try to develop other GUI, so the user would have some options which GUI to use. (Can anyone expand this idea? Or is it too difficult to implement? If it is, then you can just remove this feature)
 * Additional Protocol Modules
   Optional software modules that allows adding accounts from different instant messaging protocols and login simultaneously
