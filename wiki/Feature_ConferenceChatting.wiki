#summary Feature: Conference Chatting

Parrot IM's Conference Chatting allows you to have a conversation with multiple friends so that they can all communicate together at the same time. To begin a conference chat, simply initiate a chat with one friend, and then right click on another friend from either the Friend List or the Chat Window and click "Invite to Conference Chat". If your friends are not using Parrot IM or a similar multi-protocol program, you may only be able to talk to friends that are using one protocol, such as Google Talk or ICQ.
