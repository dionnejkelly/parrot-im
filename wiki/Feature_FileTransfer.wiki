#summary Feature: File Transfer

Just as you can send files directly to your friends, you can also receive files from them. To send a file, simply click the "Send File" option from the Chat Window, and after your friend accepts the request to receive a file, you will see the progress of your file being sent to your friend. You will both be notified when the file has been successfully sent. In receiving files, they will automatically be sent to a directory on your computer specified in the options menu.
