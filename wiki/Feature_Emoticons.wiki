#summary Feature: Emoticons

Chatting in only text can be boring. Parrot IM alleviates this by adding colourful icons to represent you and your friends' emotions as you're chatting. For instance, typing in a smile with the characters `:)' will result in an emoticon to replace it and display in your Chat Window instead. Also, your friends' characters will also be translated into emoticons and be displayed in your Chat Window.
