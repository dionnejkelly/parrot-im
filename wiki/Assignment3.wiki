= Testing Report =

Testing for the Alpha released consisted of three parts:

== Unit Testing ==

The low-level data types were checked for consistency, and each method was verified to return the expected results and make state changes to the objects as expected. The test cases are as follows:

|| *Filename* || *Components Tested* ||
|| !AccountDataTest.java || data consistency, adding friends, removing friends, searching for friends ||
|| !AccountTempDataTest.java || data consistency ||
|| !ChatbotTest || response generation, response triggering, enabler ||
|| !ChatlogMessageTempDataTest || data consistency ||
|| !ConversationDataTest || data consistency, message retrieval, message formatting, message storage ||
|| !CurrentProfileDataTest || data consistency, adding accounts, removing friends, getting friend list ||
|| !GoogleTalkUserData || data consistency ||
|| !JabberUserData || data consistency ||
|| !MessageDataTest || data consistency, message manipulation, message retrieval ||
|| !ServerTypeTest || utility methods for enumerated type ||
|| !UserDataTest || inheritance test, data consistency ||

*Results:*

Development of unit test cases allowed us to remove redundant code and add more robust methods to our low-level data. For instance, the Quality Assurance team identified methods that effectively did the same task, and merged them into one. 

Another important find was that the search functions were comparing based on an equals method inherited by the Object class. Essentially, two !UserData or !AccountData objects were treated as equal only if they had the same reference; not if their data was equal. This posed subtle problems for removing or checking for the existence of these objects. As The equals() method was overridden as a result of the test cases.

Furthermore, these tests will be conducted and updated as our low-level data types under go upgrades in future revisions of the program.

== Integration Testing ==

== User Acceptance Testing ==

= Known Bugs =

== Critical Priority ==

  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=22 Issue 22]
    * Adding and remove friends used to work fine. However, after a period, certain accounts would give the errors detailed in the issue above, making adding and removing friends impossible. It appears to be an error with the smack API, and it is impossible to recover from the exception it throws.
    * Was uncovered with integration testing using the XMPPTest test case.

== Medium Priority ==
  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=9 Issue 9]
    * Exception thrown from an unknown source 50% of the time when receiving a message. No other effects seen.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/parrot-im/issues/detail?id=10 Issue 10]
    * Exception thrown from an unknown source 25% of the time when logging in. No other effects seen.

= Coding Conventions = 
The following are the conventions used in coding Parrot IM:

== Code Style ==
Listed are the conventions for all visual aspects of the code.

=== Capitalization ===
|| *Type* || *Convention* ||
|| Packages || Start with lower case, follow in !CamelCase ||
|| Classes || Start with upper case, follow in !CamelCase ||
|| Methods || Start with lower case, follow in !CamelCase ||
|| Constants || All upper case, words separated by underscores ||
|| Data Members || Start with lower case, follow in !CamelCase ||

=== Spacing ===
|| *Type* || *Convention* ||
|| Block Indentations || 4 spaces wide ||
|| Tabs || 8 spaces wide ||
|| Maximum line size || 80 characters long ||

=== Comments ===
|| *Type* || *Convention* ||
|| Header comment || C-Style, include filename, programmers, change log, known issues, and license pointer ||
|| Classes || Include !JavaDoc comment block ||
|| Data Members || Include !JavaDoc comment block ||
|| Methods || Include !JavaDoc comment block ||
|| Single-line comments || C++ style comments ||
|| Multi-line comments || C++ or C-style comments ||
|| Commenting-out code || C++ or C-style comments ||

== Naming Conventions ==

=== Files and terms ===
Terminology:
  * *userID* - The username, with the "@server.com" for a friend or an account.
  * *account* - Represents one userID for the local user. Used to log-in to the server.
  * *profile* - An identity that contains a list of accounts for the local user.
  * *friends* - A list of userIDs in an account, shown in the buddy list.

Filename conventions:
  * Data types, such as an Account or Profile, are suffixed with "DataType" in the filename.
  * Enumerated types are suffixed with "Type" in the filename.
  * Test cases are suffixed with "Test" in the filename.

=== Data Hierarchy ===
The Model holds Conversations and Profiles.   

Model's Chat Data:
  * !ConversationData has:
    * !MessageData

Model's Profile Data
  * !CurrentProfileData has:
    * !AccountData, which has:
      * !UserData
