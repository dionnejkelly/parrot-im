#summary Presentation rough notes.

Link to [http://parrot-im.googlecode.com/files/parrotIM_PresentationOne.ppt ROUGH copy] of presentation. It has no slide transitions yet, nor background, and looks ugly. Will fix. Need to change content, make it less wordy, and associate speech to the slide. Ending is rough. Please make any comments with regards to content, and give ideas for anything. Feel free to make changes to the file or edit this page. Possible edits:

==Introduction==
 * Communication
    * Why make another chat client? There are already many programs that do the following:
       * have many users and have decent functionality (e.g. MSN, AOL, ICQ)
       * can work with multiple protocols (e.g. Trillian, Pidgin)
       * ... Twitter, Facebook, IRC...
    * Flaws in existing programs:
       * Some allow you to only communicate over one protocol
          * If you have friends that use different programs, you may not be able to communicate with each other
       * Do you trust your instant messenger?
          * Many clients are proprietary, and you have no way of knowing the source code
       * Confusing--too many buttons, but none of the buttons do what you want
          * Need a simple interface without sacrificing function
       * Customization
          * Certain more 'computer-literate' individuals often like to personalize their own software, instant messengers included
       * Most of them have ads and spywares
    * How we communicate...
       * Should be:
          * fun
          * easy
          * accessible 
    * Can do better. We need a feature-rich, but easy-to-use, chat client that works with multiple protocols and operates efficiently. All of this should be open source.

==The Solution==

 * We present: Parrot Instant Messenger
    * Main goals
       * easy to use - Running Parrot IM should allow you to chat to everyone who uses a computer. No technical skills should be required--the interface should be intuitive and clear.  Users shouldn't be made to navigate through a bunch of useless tabs, buttons, and flashy ads just to find the chat log button.
       * full of useful features - Want to let your friends know what you're doing, but don't want to announce it to the world? Get the Chatbot to tell them for you! Forgot where you're supposed to meet your friend? Don't parse the chat logs with your eyes! Search for "friday meet Alice where" and find out in less than a second. Parrot IM can do anything you need, but will not complicate your chatting.
       * be enjoyable! - Chatting in real life is fun. Why should it be anything less on the computer? With Parrot IM, you have all the tools you need at your fingertips to express yourself. You do not need a technical background to use our software.

    * Refer to architectural diagram, talk about individual features

==Behind the Scenes==

 * What's in a name; why Parrot IM?
    * You can teach a parrot to say anything in any language. Parrot IM is similar in that you can use it to do many things; you do not need to rely on an array of programs to talk to your friends.
    * Parrots are attractive, and so is our user interface. Chatting is more than just protocols and text. 

 * Who is responsible for creating Parrot IM?
    * Well, Pirates, of course!
    * Talk about our group.
       * All learning to be software engineers.
       * Group organized into subgroups, but everyone has an equal voice
       * Roles...
