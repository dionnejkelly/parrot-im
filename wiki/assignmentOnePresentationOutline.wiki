   * Why make another chat client? There are already many programs that do the following:
      * have many users and have decent functionality (e.g. MSN, AOL, ICQ)
      * can work with multiple protocols (e.g. Trillium)
      * ... Twitter, Facebook, IRC...
   * _show pictures and functionality of other programs_
   * Can do better. We need a feature-rich, but easy-to-use, chat client that works with multiple protocols and operates efficiently.
