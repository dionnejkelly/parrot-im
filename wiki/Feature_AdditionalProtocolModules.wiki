#summary Feature: Additional Protocol Modules

Just as you can talk to friends that use the XMPP, Twitter, and ICQ protocols, you will be able to talk to more friends from other networks. Although we have not finalized the additional protocols you can connect with, we plan to implement the MSN and AIM protocols. Once implemented, you can add friends from the MSN (Windows Live) and AIM networks through the add-a-friend window. You will also be able to log-in through your own MSN or AIM account, and your existing friend list from each account will automatically be imported into your Parrot IM friend list.
