*Section I: For the User*

_Kevin -- 45 seconds_

Introduction:
  * introduce team Pirate Captains, note people on floor

Summary:
  * For the last 3 months, we have developed Parrot Instant Messenger
  * It is an instant messenger that can connect to multiple networks: google, twitter, and msn, and provides fun communication with cool features, such as chat bot, custom themes, and smart searching.

_Jihoon -- 4 minutes_

Features:
  * pair with ss, jihoon talk?

*Section II: For the Developer*

_Ahmad -- 2 minutes_

Components:
  * Present new architectural diagram. Also show the old version.
  * Highlight how our architecture is ordered with Model View Controller. 
  * Note that the Controller works with libraries to connect via protocols, the View handles GUI input and output, and the Model holds data, and holds a Database.
  * Contrast to hold diagram, with no MVC... essentially we just categorized features in the old one, instead of designing an architecture.

Statistics:
  * Known bugs
  * % implemented features
  * Metrics
QA (How do we know that Parrot IM is bug-free?):
