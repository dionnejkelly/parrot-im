#summary Feature: UI Customization

The user interface comes included with a default background image, and preset colours for the windows. Both the background images and colours can be changed by the user in the options menu. The background image can be set to any picture of the .jpeg, .bmp, or .png format. For each window, there is a corresponding colour selection in the options menu, which presents you with a full palette with every colour.
