#summary Known issues of Parrot IM.

= Critical Issues =
  * Twitter Server Rejections
    * After too many connections to the Twitter server, it would reject our requests for any information. Our library has no way of throttling requests upon approaching the limit.
  * MSN Add/Remove Friend delay
    * MSNM (library for MSN) lacked many features, as it was intended for an earlier version of MSN. 
  * Rare authentication failure on Google Talk
    * Smack (library for XMPP) sometimes returned a bad connection exception upon attempting to log in with a valid userID and password.
  * With msn, if you connect with guest account it will alow you in even with a false password. 

= Major Issues =
  * Friend Avatar Mismatch
  * MSN Buddy list sometimes does not load upon connecting
  * If connected on multiple accounts that have the same friend, you cannot chat to the friend "from" both accounts; only one will be accepted.
  * Multi-user chat for Google Talk occasionally will not receive invites to chat.
  * If you hover on your contacts in the buddy list, it will tell you in the blue background that status are offline! that's for all contacts in buddy list.

= Minor Issues =
  * When type :D it becomes :D>
  * For Linux, sometimes the window shortcut for parrotIM.jar will hide.
  * As you chat with another user, the font color will keep changing.
