If you want to send a friend a message, but he or she is offline, you can still open a chat window and send a message. Instead of receiving this message immediately, your friend will see your message the next time he or she logs in. This can be useful when you are chatting to a friend who temporarily loses their internet connection. This features ensures that none of your messages are lost; each message will be sent eventually.
