Some networks you connect to also offer email services. Parrot IM will notify you when you receive new emails. For example, if you are connected on the Google Talk protocol, an email notification will appear in Parrot IM's Main Window whenever you receive new email to your Gmail account. Some users prefer to not see their email notifications, and therefore there will be an option to turn off this feature in the options menu.
