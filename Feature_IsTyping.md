Many instant messaging programs allow you to see when your friend is currently typing you a message. Also, anything you type in the chat box will trigger this "is typing" message to be given to your friend. Parrot IM's system is different in that allows you full control as to whether these notifications are received or sent. By default, when a friend is typing to you, the "is typing" message will display at the bottom of the Chat Window. However, you can turn this off in the options menu. Similarly, you may set it so that your friend is not alerted when you are typing a message. Having this extra measure of control is another way in which you can retain more privacy while using Parrot IM.
