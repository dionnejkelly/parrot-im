Different sound notifications will play upon the following events:
  * You receive a new message
  * A friend starts chatting to you
  * You successfully sign-in
  * You are disconnected from Parrot IM
  * A friend signs in

Each sound is different, which allows you to keep track of which friends are asking for your attention, even when you aren't looking at your computer. However, some people dislike sounds playing for certain events. In the options menu, you can choose exactly which sound you want to play for which events. For example, you can turn all sounds off, or set custom sounds for certain events.
