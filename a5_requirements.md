# Introduction #

Parrot Instant Messenger is a desktop application that connects you to friends on multiple networks, and offers useful, fun features such as tabbed conversations, programmable chatbot, chatlog and buddy search, and custom UI.

The program is expected to provide services to users who will run Parrot IM whenever they wish to be connected to their friends and that they will prefer to run Parrot IM over existing messaging solutions, such as ICQ, MSN, and Google Talk.

# Non-Functional Requirements #

### Product Requirements ###
  * **Usability:** The user interface for Parrot IM shall be implemented as simple features, yet powerful, that will allow many users to enjoy their conversations as naturally as if they were talking face-to-face.
  * **Usability:** The Parrot IM is compatible with multiple protocols, including XMPP, to target any age and audience.
  * **Performance Requirements:** The program will execute, and the log-in window will show within 8 seconds.
  * **Performance Requirements:** The program will occupy between 10 MB and 60 MB of RAM while running.
  * **Reliability Requirements:** The number of faults found during testing (i.e., before delivery) will be no more than 50 based upon programmer information regarding failures found before release of the software.
  * **Reliability Requirements:** The failures (or other problems) reported by users after delivery will be no more than 20 based upon customer information regarding failures found after release of the software.
  * **Portability Requirements:** Parrot IM is able to run on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating environments.

### Organizational Requirements ###
  * **Process Standards:** The system development process and deliverable documents shall conform to the process and deliverables defined in Design Document.
  * **Process Standards:** Parrot IM will follow the conventional programming style of Java [coding](http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/).
  * **Implementation Requirements:** Java programming language will be used in Eclipse IDE. (We also need which design method is going to be used)
  * **Delivery Requirements:**
    * Alpha Release: June 26th, 2009
    * Beta Release: July 17th, 2009
    * Final Release: July 31st, 2009

### External requirements ###
  * **Interoperability Requirements:** The program shall not disclose any personal information about program users apart from their name and email address to the Parrot IM users who use the program.
  * **Interoperability Requirements:** Parrot IM will only be releasing our source code under the GPL V2 and interact with systems in other organizations using SQLiteJDBC v054 driver and Smack 3.1.0 interface.
  * **Legislative Requirements:** The program should not use our technical skills and abilities to behave in a dishonest way that misuses other people's computers.
  * **Ethical Requirements:** The Parrot IM software engineers shall be bounded by the Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct to participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

A program goal: The program should be easy to use by anyone (experienced or inexperienced) and should be organized in such a way that errors are minimized.

A verifiable non-functional requirement: Any (experienced or inexperienced) controllers shall be able to use all the system functions after a total of 1 hourâ€™s (temporary) training. After this training, the average number of errors made by any users shall not exceed one (temporary) per day.

Metrics for specifying non-functional requirements:

### The Non-functional Requirements Table ###
| Property | Measure |
|:---------|:--------|
| Speed    | User/Event response time. Messages should be sent within 1 second, and then it will be received by the user as long as their connection is currently stable. The program will execute, and the log-in window will show within 8 seconds on any computer of a Pentium 4 class or higher, or around 1 GHz of CPU capability. Parrot IM will log-in on all selected networks in maximum 30 seconds before the connection times out. Ideally, the client will log-in under 10 seconds. |
| Size     | Hard disk Requirements = The program will take up to 10 MB on the computer's hard drive to function all the features of Parrot IM that includes storing users' profile and their preference, sound notification, and images. <br> Memory Requirements = The program will occupy between 30 MB and 70 MB of RAM while running. <br>
<tr><td> Ease of Use </td><td> Training time = A user who has had no exposure to other instant messaging programs will learn to create a user profile, log-in, add friends, and chat with their friends within 1 hour of training from the Parrot instructor. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Reliability </td><td> Mean time to failure = The number of faults found during testing (i.e., before delivery) will be no more than 50 based upon programmer information regarding failures found before release of the software. The failures (or other problems) reported by users after delivery will be no more than 20 based upon customer information regarding failures found after release of the software. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Robustness </td><td> Time to restart after failure = The program will take up to 15 seconds to restart after a software failure. <br> Percentage of events causing failure  = 2% of internal (i.e., incorrect input data)/external (i.e., power failure)/events causing software failure. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Portability </td><td> Can be used on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating environments. </td></tr></tbody></table>
